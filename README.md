# arcViz

An arc diagram uses a one-dimensional layout of nodes, with circular arcs to represent links. Though an arc diagram may not convey the overall structure of the graph as effectively as a two-dimensional layout, with a good ordering of nodes it is easy to identify cliques and bridges. Further, as with the indented tree, multivariate data can easily be displayed alongside nodes.

This network represents character co-occurrence in the chapters of Victor Hugo's classic novel, Les Mis√©rables. Node colors depict cluster memberships computed by a community-detection algorithm.
